# Election_Analysis

## Overview of Project
Originally this project was to create a vote count report based on the election ballots for a Colorado election commisssion. Instead of using excel, the manager wanted to know if we could use python to automate the process. After completing this report, the election commission asked for new data to finish the audit. In this analysis you will find the total number votes cast, the county with the largest turnout and the winning candidate along with their vote count and their precntage of the total votes.


## Results
•The total number of votes for this election was 369,711.  To get the total number of votes counted I initialized a total vote counter.

•	There were three different counties in the election Arapahoe, Denver and Jefferson. Here is a list of the total percentage of votes each county received along with the total number of votes.

    o	Denver: 82.8%   Total Votes = 306,055
    o	Arapahoe: 6.7% Total Votes = 24,801
    o	Jefferson:10.5% Total Votes = 38,855
              
 We used the following code to calculate the percentages for each county.

•The county with the largest number of votes was Denver with 306,055 votes. To find the county with the largest turn out I started by tracking largest county and county voter turnout.

Then I wrote a decision statement that would add the county with the largest vote count to the two variables I created above.
